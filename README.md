## **‚≠êÔ∏è About Me:**

> **<span style="color:blue">"Passion for technology, combined with determination and the ability to overcome challenges, can take us to places we never imagined."</span>**

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm Elena Villalba, a robotics and electronic engineering enthusiast. A few years ago, I stumbled upon Arduino for the first time, a microcontroller that opened the doors to a universe of creative possibilities for me. Captivated by the idea of bringing my projects to life, I decided to immerse myself in the fascinating world of robotics.

  üéì Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis, a project that represents the culmination of my studies and reflects my passion for engineering. You can take a look at my journey in the [ros2-robotino](https://github.com/evillalbaa/robotino4-ros2) repository, where I share my discoveries and challenges as I navigate the world of robotics and dive into the ROS 2 environment.
    
  üöú But my journey doesn't stop here. When I'm not immersed in my thesis, you'll find me exploring new horizons in the field of research. I'm part of a research team at CDEI-UPC dedicated to developing agricultural robots. Imagine combining engineering with agriculture to create innovative solutions that positively impact our world! You can find us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cdei-upc/) to learn more about our projects.

  üåê Through this space on GitHub, I hope to share my journey, my discoveries, and my passion for technology.
